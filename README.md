# FarageBot
Can't Barage Bot the Modular Discord Farage Bot!

~~Currently FarageBot only has linux support. A Windows port is *hopefully* coming soon.~~  
FarageBot has untested, experimental Windows support, you will have to figure out how to build it yourself though.. (I couldn't get SleepyDiscord to build with mingw so I have been unable to test.)  

Real readme coming soon, but for now...

# Installation
```
cd source
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

The automated setup script will walk you through the entire process painlessly.

Example modules and API documentation coming soon!

Some base modules are also currently in development.

# Farage API Documentation

This is a work in progress, so check back frequently https://github.com/noglass/FarageBot/wiki/
