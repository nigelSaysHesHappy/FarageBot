# Compiling

Run the `build.sh` script directly from the `./source/modules/` directory, instructing it to build rps.cpp:
```
./build.sh --install examples/rockpaperscissors/rps.cpp
```

# Setup

Before loading the module, make sure you have copied the `rps.ini` file to the root directory of FarageBot.
