# FarageBot
Can't Barage Bot the Modular Discord Farage Bot!

Currently FarageBot only has linux support. A Windows port is *hopefully* coming soon.

Real readme coming soon, but for now...

# Installation
```
cd source
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

The automated setup script will walk you through the entire process painlessly.

Example modules and API documentation coming soon!

Some base modules are also currently in development.
